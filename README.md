# Pandas Project
This project utilizes Pandas for Python-based analysis of educational assessment data within school contexts.

The main analysis is performed in the notebook named 'PyCitySchools.ipynb', which can be found in the PyCitySchools folder.

The analysis begins by condensing the student data to provide an insightful overview of the Local Government Area (LGA Summary). Then, a detailed breakdown is conducted to summarize the data on a per-school basis, making it easier to identify top-performing and underperforming schools based on the overall passing percentage, which includes both math and reading scores. Furthermore, the data is segmented by year level to present math and reading scores at a more detailed level. Finally, the analysis explores the relationship between scores and variables such as school spending per student, school size, and school type.

Additionally, a comprehensive written analysis of the overall data is provided at the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook.
