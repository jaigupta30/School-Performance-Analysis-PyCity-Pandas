# Pandas-Project

Utilizing Pandas for Python-based analysis of educational assessment data within school contexts.

The notebook named 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' located in the PyCitySchools folder serves as the foundation for this analysis.

Initially, the student data is condensed to offer an insightful overview of the Local Government Area (LGA Summary). Subsequently, an in-depth breakdown is performed to summarize the data on a per-school basis, facilitating the identification of top-performing and underperforming schools based on the overall passing percentage encompassing both math and reading scores. Furthermore, the data is segmented by year level to present math and reading scores at a granular level. Lastly, the analysis delves into examining scores in relation to variables such as school spending per student, school size, and school type.

Additionally, a comprehensive written analysis of the overall data is provided at the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook.
